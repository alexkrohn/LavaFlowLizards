# LavaFlowLizards

This repository houses markdown files that will guide you through the analyses of my paper on genome-wide differentiation in lava flow lizards.

For the dadi analyses, I've only included the script that allows you to convert the output of ANGSD (-doGeno 5) to the correct dadi input. From there, you can follow the excellent scripts of [Dan Portik](https://github.com/dportik/dadi_pipeline) to replicate my work.

Note that the **data** folder contains the input files for most of the analyses.
